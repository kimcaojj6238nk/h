            <p>My name is <span class="kim-cao">Kim Cao</span>. I am an international student from Vietnam. This is the fifth year I have been in the US. I have learned and experienced so many different things during the time I live here. I am so glad that I have a lot of opportunities to meet new friends, explore new cultures, and pursue my passion in the US.</p></div>

        <div id="educationcontent">    
            <p>I graduated in Fall 2020 with my Bachelor of Science in Art Education and a minor in Mathematics. When I first attended MNSU as a freshman, my major was Mathematics Education. I switched to Art after two years because I want to try different things and art is always my passion. Last year, I decided to add Graphic Design as my second major since it only takes me one more year to complete the program. Also, Graphic Design has been my concentration for years but now I want to learn about this field more seriously.</p>

            <p>Since I was young, there are three things that I always have strong passion about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Art</strong></li>
            <p>I love all kinds of fine arts: painting, printmaking, sculpture, installation, etc. My most favorite art medium is ceramics. I have been working on wheels for two years and I love it. For me art is not only a career but it is also a passion. If you want to check out my work, here is the link to <a href="https://www.behance.net/kimcao3">my Behance page</a> .</p> 
            <li><strong>Sport</strong></li>
            <p>I am a sportsperson who doesn&#8217;t like exercise. I often force myself to go to the gym but I don&#8217;t really enjoy it. For me, playing sports is more interesting and when you play you forget about the fatigue. My most favorite sport is badminton. I have played it since I was seven years old. I used to play professionally for my city&#8217;s junior team when I was in middle and high school. This was one of my regular excercise schedules last year when there was no pandemic:</p>

            </table><br/>
            <li><strong>Food</strong></li>
            <p>My third hobby is about food. I love cooking and trying new foods. One of the things that I miss the most when I leave my country is my hometown food. I can think about them all day. I also love American food. I usually try new recipes every weekend. Whenever I travel, I do research about the place I go and which restaurants I have to try out. They always give my good memories and a full stomach.</p>

        <div id="ambitionscontent">
            <p>My short-term goal is to become an educator. I love teaching and working with people. I have been working at MNSU as a Math tutor since 2017 because it is a really good way for me to practice and improve my teaching skills. For the long-term I know I want to pursue MFA in Graphic Design. After my graduation this year, hopefully I can work as a freelancer or a graphic teacher for high schoolers.</p>
